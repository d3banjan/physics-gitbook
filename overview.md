# Overview of Quantum Mechanics
A common saying about quantum particles is that they have wave-particle duality. This is not a bad analogy for a first introduction. But what if one wanted to visualize what that means? 

We have physical intuitions of what a **particle** and a **wave** mean from the world that we see. **Particle**s are localized to a single point in three dimensional space. **Wave**s, on the other hand, exist on a continuum of points that form a surface or line.  Furthermore, a **particle** can occupy a sequence of other points as time changes; a **wave** would undulate over time: an infinite number of three dimensional points inside each time-snapshot.

Saying that "something changes with time" is quite a paradoxical statement to make. There have to be certain *timeless* truths/labels/quantities that form the identity of the particle to begin with. And other properties of "something" have to *change* over time. 

In order to train intuition, which Quantum Mechanics is famous for defying, we need to formalize what we mean by a classical particle, a classical wave and a quantum particle.   
Let us say that we can form a mathematical set out of the different properties of a **classical particle**, intrinsic and time varying, and then label that set to be a classical particle.  
A similar set can also be formed for a **classical wave**, instead of location we feed in information about the infinite number of points that define it. We already know how to do that from high school math. We use mathematical objects called **bijective functions** that can take in an infinite number of numbers and spit out the same as output.
