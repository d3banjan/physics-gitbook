# Overview of Quantum Mechanics
A common saying about quantum particles is that they have wave-particle duality. This is not a bad analogy for a first introduction. But what if one wanted to visualize what that means? 

We have physical intuitions of what a **particle** and a **wave** mean from the world that we see. **Particle**s are localized to a single point in three dimensional space. **Wave**s, on the other hand, exist on a continuum of points that from a surface or line.  Furthermore a **particle** could occupy a sequence of other points as time changes; a **wave** would undulate with time - an infinite number of three dimensional points in each time snapshot.

Saying that "something changes with time" is quite a paradoxical statement to make. There have to be certain truths that form the identity of the
